# Network-Fault-Tolerance-Using-WSN
This work explores network fault tolerance to ensure continuous service delivery despite errors and failures. Using MATLAB, we simulate a virtual network to study fault-tolerant routing systems and algorithms, aiming to balance fault tolerance, resource usage, and performance.
